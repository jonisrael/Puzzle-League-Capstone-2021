    "Swap blocks horizontally to align them. You can use X or S...",
    "Along with (experimental!) game controller support (Press A/B)...",
    "And (very experimental!!) mobile screen support.",
    "If on mobile, draw an arrow order to move blocks horizontally",

    "Match three to get points and clear the board...",
    "match more than three for a small bonus...",
    "...and a compliment from the announcer.",

    "Airborne blocks cannot match with each other.",
    "You also cannot swap airborne blocks in most cases...",
    "and blocks always stall midair shortly before falling.",

  [
    "The best way to score points is through block chains.",
    "Form block chains by setting up automatic matches like below.",
    "We prepare matches to land on each after the original clears.",
    "A fanfare jingle will signal a chain was made.",
    "Large chains will greatly increase bonuses received",
  ],
  [
    "Press Z/R/Raise to self-lift the stack, like the AI does here.",
    "The higher the stack, the larger the chains that are possible...",
    "but the greater the risk of topping out and losing.",

  [
    "The main game lasts approximately two minutes.",
    "Every 20 seconds the speed of the game slightly increases...",
    "But so does the score gained from future matches.",
    "At two minutes, the game speed triples. This stage is called overtime.",
    "It is very hard to survive. However, score gained here will be very high...",
    "And for every second survived you get a large bonus.",
  ],
  [
    "The stack immediately stops rising if any block is airborne or clearing...",
    "And creating a 4+ match or 2+ chain will also add a small amount of delay.",
    "The larger the chain or match, the more delay you can receive.",
    "Delay becomes less effective as game speed increases and cannot exceed 5 seconds.",
    "These techniques are essential to survival during overtime!",
