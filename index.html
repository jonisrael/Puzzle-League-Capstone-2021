    <h1>Welcome to Jonathan Israel's Puzzle League Score Rush!</h1>
    <h2>
        Use the arrow keys to move, x to swap blocks, and z to raise the stack when legal.<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Clear blocks by matching 3 adjacent blocks.  If you match 4 or more you will get more points.
        Create chains by matching a second combo on top of a recently cleared combo before the blocks fall.
        Chains will get you the most points. You lose when the stack reaches the top. 
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The stack rise speed will get faster every 20 seconds, which also increases the multiplier of combos/chians by 0.1x.
        At two minutes, "overtime" begins, and the stack rise speed will be extremely fast.  However, all point scores will be doubled at 2.0x. Have fun!
