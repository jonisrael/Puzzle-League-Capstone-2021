      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>
        The game itself was coded by me from the ground up, and attempts to
        replicate the original Panel De Pon mechanics as best as possible.
        However, I received a lot of help from the
        <a href="https://savvycoders.com/meettheteam/">Savvy Coders Team</a> in
        regards to other website features. These features include converting the
        game into a Single-Page-Application, deploying the site to
        <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, get datetime information
        from <a href="https://worldtimeapi.org/">WorldTimeAPI</a>, and use a
        <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com/">Mongo-DB</a> database to host the
        leaderboard information on <a href="heroku.com">Heroku</a>.
