    <p>
      Puzzle League is a tetris-like game created by Intelligent Systems Co. in
      Japan. The player arranges 3 or more adjacent blocks (also known as
      panels) with the same color to create a combo and clear them from the
      board. You can also do more advanced techniques such as chains to gain
      more points. Usually the main game is multiplayer, where creating combos
      and chains sends garbage blocks to your opponent on top of their stack to
      top them out.

      Since 1995, there have been a couple of Puzzle League games released. It
      also had an interesting history on what regions of the world various games
      were released in. Here are the list of games that created new content:

      Panel De Pon (1995) was the first game, released exclusively in Japan. The
      story featured a fairy named Lip that was working to rescue her fairy
      friends from monsters who were using their magic to send an endless
      rainstorm on their fairyland. Since developers did not think this
      storyline would work well for Western Audiences, it was rebranded with the
      name Tetris Attack (1996) and instead starred Yoshi from the Mario series
      as the main protagonist. The gameplay and most of the music stayed the
      same, but many of the images and sprites were altered to fit the theme.
      The story was changed so that Yoshi was rescuing his friends after they
      were cursed by Bowser and his minions. This version was released
      worldwide.

      In 2000, the game was given another update using the Pokemon series as a
      framework. The game featured many of the same modes but added more stages,
      puzzles, and challengers. The AI computer opponents were improved as well,
      having the ability to make chains. This was something the Tetris Attack AI
      could not do. The game also add a 3D mode which was the same as 2D except
      that it used 18 columns in the shape of a see-through cylinder rather than
      the standard 6 columns.

      In 2007, Planet Puzzle League was released worldwide on the Nintendo DS.
      This version was simply a puzzle game with no specific storyline and with
      no connection to other Nintendo series. The biggest changes were that this
      version gave players the opportunity for online play and the use of a
      touchscreen. Today, Panel De Pon can be played on the Nintendo Switch
      using the Super Nintendo app, letting a new audience experience this
      classic game.
