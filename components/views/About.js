        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jonathan Israel and I am the creator of this web
          application. This is part of my capstone project for the Savvy Coders
          coding boot camp. I am a graduate of UMSL with a math major.
          Currently, I am a chess teacher at the Saint Louis Chess Club. We
          travel to different elementary and middle schools to teach chess to
          hundreds of students. I first learned chess when I was about six years
          old, playing it competitively in high school. While I am not
          participating in competitions like I used to, I enjoy teaching chess
          to students at all levels.

          <br /><br />I chose to participate in this coding boot camp because I
          was looking for a career change that would allow me to apply my math
          abilities in order to help a company with their business. Remembering
          that I enjoyed some computer science classes in college, I looked into
          coding. After using the website Free Code Camp to practice and learn
          some basics, I signed up for Savvy Coders to pursue this new career
          opportunity.

          <br /><br />For this capstone, I chose to clone a game and design a
          web application around it. The original is a game similar to Tetris
          called Planet Puzzle League. Since video games are a hobby of mine, I
          grew up with this game but it has a very niche following. I wanted to
          undertake a coding challenge that would introduce a game that most
          people have never heard of. I have greatly enjoyed the troubleshooting
          and problem solving aspect of coding this game and look forward to
          continuing to apply the skills I have learned in future coding
          projects.
