        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a scholastic chess teacher at the Saint Louis Chess Club, where we
          travel to different elementary and middle schools to teach chess to
          hundreds of students. I first learned chess when I was about six years
          old, and got into playing it more competitively in high school. I am
          since not as competitive as I used to be, but I very much enjoy
          teaching students of all levels. I was looking for a career change, so
          I started looking at coding. I used free code camp for a little bit,
          and after realizing I enjoyed it, I looked for a coding boot camp. I
          chose Saavy Coders because I was looking for a career change, and I
          would like to apply my math abilities in coding in order to help a
          company with their business challenges. For my capstone, I chose to
          clone a old tetris-similar game series called Planet Puzzle League. I
          also grew up with this game, and since it is kind of a niche game, I
          wanted to try and undertake a new coding challenge that has not been
          cloned very much. Let me show you more information!
